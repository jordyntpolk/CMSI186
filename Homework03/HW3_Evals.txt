HighRoll          : won't compile due to DiceSet      - 0 point

Total 11 out of 30 = 36.67% which is an F

Jordyn, I'm sorry for the low score.  There were 24 compile errors in your DiceSet
code.  This kept me from evaluating that module, and because it won't compile, I
can't compile and run either the test harness or the HighRoll game file.

Please feel free to contact me during office hours for help if you need it.  I
would really like to help you understand and master this material if you want to
do so!
